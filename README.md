🚀 Project Update! ✋📹

Thrilled to announce our progress on Task-04 with Prodigy Infotech: developing a hand gesture recognition model for intuitive human-computer interaction. 🖥️✨

Objective: Develop a model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling gesture-based control systems.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather and organize a comprehensive dataset of hand gestures from images and videos.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Development: Implement a robust model to recognize and classify various hand gestures.
Model Training: Train the model using advanced techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.
Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for optimal results.
Deployment: Integrate the model into applications for intuitive human-computer interaction.
Excited to see how this technology can transform user experiences! 🌟
